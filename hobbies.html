    <h4>Weight Training</h4>
        <p>
            Ever since I was 15 years old, I've had a passion for lifting weights. As a scrawny teenager, it was exciting to see my musculature develop and lift heavier weights every week.
    </br>   Over my 12-years of weight training, I've learned that few things happen overnight, and being consistent and relentless toward your goals is the only way to achieve big things.
    </br>   My lifetime records:
    </br>   <li>Bench press: 320 lb</li>
            <li>Back squat: 440 lb</li>
            <li>Conventional deadlift: 535 lb</li>
            <li>Shoulder press: 205 lb</li>
