    <h3>&#9654 Weight Training</h3>
        <p>
            Ever since I was 15 years old, I've had a passion for lifting weights. As a scrawny teenager, it was exciting to see my musculature develop and lift heavier weights every week.
            Over 12-years of weight training, I've learned that few things happen overnight, and being consistent and relentless toward your goals is the only way to achieve big things.
    <h3>My lifetime records</h3>
    </br>   <li>Bench press: 320 lb</li>
            <li>Back squat: 440 lb</li>
            <li>Conventional deadlift: 535 lb</li>
            <li>Shoulder press: 205 lb</li>
        </p>

    <h3>&#9654 ThinkPad Modding & Optimization</h3>
    <p>
            It may sound strange to the uninitiated, but ThinkPads are seriously neat laptops. I've owned five and kept three of those, being a T520, X220, and T60.
    <h3>T520</h3>
            <li>OS: dual-boot Linux Mint and Windows 10</li>
            <li>Screen: upgraded from 1366x768p to 1920x1080p</li>
            <li>CPU: upgraded from dual-core i5-2520M to quad-core i7-2760QM</li>
            <li>RAM: upgraded from 4GB single-channel @ 1333MHz to 8GB dual-channel @ 1600MHz</li>
            <li>WiFi: upgraded from stock to Dell Intel AC 7260 (300 Mbps to 1200 Mbps)</li>
            <li>BIOS: modded to unlock advanced features and remove whitelist</li>
    </p>
    <p>
            The first issue I ran into was poor CPU thermals both at idle and under load. After all, this model's fan wasn't intended to cool a quad-core i7.
            To bring down the heat, I slightly lowered the max CPU frequency and adjusted the fan speeds and trip points in the modified BIOS.
            By defualt, these were set to 55C and 71C with speeds of ~1200RPM and ~2400RPM.
            By changing the lo trip point to 47C and the hi trip point to 63C with respective speeds of 2400 RPM and 6400 RPM, I was able to prevent thermal throttling from ever being in the cards.
            And it may seem counter-productive, but enabling hyper-threading was also beneficial. With hyper-threading enabled, CPU core temps were slightly higher under load (2-3 C).
            But tasks finished so much faster that the CPU was able to cool sooner and had a much lower average temperature over time.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>X220 & T60</h3>
            <li>OS: Debian and Zorin OS, respectively</li>
            <li>Secondary storage: HDD to SSD</li>
    </p>
    <p>     No other modifications were made to these laptops. But eventually I intend on replacing the X220's stock BIOS with coreboot and upgrading the screen to an IPS.
            The T60 was the last model without Intel ME, so I keep it around for privacy reasons.
